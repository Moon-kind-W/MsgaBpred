# Run MsgaBpred for training
After building our dataset epitope3D, train the model with default hyper params:
* ``python train.py``
# Run MsgaBpred for prediction
Please execute the following command directly if you can provide the PDB file.
If you do not have a PDB file, you can use AlphaFold3 to predict the protein structure.
